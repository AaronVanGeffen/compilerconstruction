\section{Intermediate Representation}
\todo[inline]{Idea: simplify to something that looks more like asm. Unrolls stuff, less fancy constructs, explain what remains.}

\section{Simple Stack Machine}
\todo[inline]{Explain how registers aren't needed, how stack works, globals on stack as pseudo-heap, lists and tuples on heap, calling convention}

\section{Reflection}
\todo[inline]{IR too simple: loss of context, temporaries hard to distinguish (LDC, LDL) and thus aren't thrown away as they are treated like regular vars.}
